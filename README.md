# Hi, I'm Sayan 👋

I'm an MSc Physics student at Jadavpur University with a keen interest in:

-  Quantum Computing & Quantum Machine Learning  
-  Quantum Materials & Computational Material Science  
-  Nanoscience and Nanotechnology  

I enjoy working at the intersection of **physics, algorithms and code** — building simulations, exploring quantum algorithms, and connecting them to real-world problems like batteries, materials, photonics and so on.

### 🔭 What I'm doing

- Implementing **quantum algorithms** (QFT, Grover, QPE, VQE) using Qiskit  
- Exploring **quantum algorithms for battery electrode optimisation**  
- Studying **quantum materials & model Hamiltonians**  
- Preparing for **quantum R&D internships** in India and abroad  

---

### 🧰 Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Python (OOP, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas), LaTeX  
- **Quantum:** Qiskit, Quantum Computing Algorithms, Quantum Simulation  
- **Data & Viz:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gnuplot, MySQL  
- **Other:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub
